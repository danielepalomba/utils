# Stampa vocale
Simple Python script created to make my colleagues' work easier when printing packaging labels. With this program the employee no longer has to scan the code and approach the PC to print the label but can send the print simply by voice.

**To create a executable:**
```bash     
pip install pyinstaller
```
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile script.py
```
